Hi! My name is Jo√£o and I'm currently a QA Engineer based in Portugal, working remotely for UK-based companies for the past 2 years.

I have around 10 years of experience in the IT industry, and my goal is to compile and share all the knowledge I have gathered through all these years regarding shifting to an IT career as well as improving and managing an IT career to one's goals.

I hope this knowledge helps you improve your current situation, regardless of whether you want to move into the industry without being a techie or if you are already here and just want to reach your career goals. 

My tips will be more detailed within QA and development roles and will be more broad but still useful in Product Ownership and Engineering leadership.

All this knowledge was **gained by getting to know the market in Europe and the UK, as well as sharing and openly talking about salaries, career decisions, benefits, and interviews** with all the people I've had the pleasure to work with. These people were performing multiple roles, and a lot of them even changed roles. 

If these tips have helped you or you believe that they will have a positive impact on your career, please kindly consider clicking on the <u>support me</u> button located on the bottom left of the page and support this work with a small amount donation. Please also feel free to drop me a message on linkedin or email with any feedback or suggestion and please share these tips with colleagues anf friends.
