# Reasons to move into the Tech industry
Why would one want to move into the tech industry? For many reasons, if you like computers you may be happier if you move, maybe you are on a very populated and competetive field or just tired and want to try something new. Anyways, these are the main reasons I would sell to you to convince you as I did to many friends.

## Salary
Salaries are overall higher in the tech industry. Since there is, currently, a lot of demand and not so much supply salaries tend to be higher when compared to other areas. For example a junior developer or qa can easily earn something between 30000€ to 40000€ gross/anual. The value significantly increases once that person gets to mid and senior level. A Senior developer or qa can earn something between 50000€ to 90000€. There are ofcourse people that earn even more, these ranges are what I find to be the most common and already including some very succesful cases regarding salary.

List of data proving these values:

## Life Quality

If you like remote working that is something that you can currently easily achieve in the tech industry. Even if you don't work fully remote a lot of companies offer hybrid formats, like 2 days in office and 3 days at home. Some companies are already offering 4 days work weeks instead of the traditional 5 days per week. Flexible schedule is very easy to find since most companies practice this somehow, this allows you to pick up your kids from school, go to the doctor, do anything you need to do during the day without being punished. People are usually quite happy and since there is not a lot of competition the work environment is usually healthy and fun.

## Job stability
Even people that are currently being laid off, since a lot of tech companies took a hit with the current economic situation, were able to quickly find another job doing the exact same thing and some times even increase their benefits (salary or other perks). People that were not laid off are still chaning when a better opportunity appears, this happens quite often. This leads me to conclude the market is still very much alive.

# How I moved into the tech industry
I was on a horrible law internship experience for almost a year when I decided to quit and do something else as I was really unhappy there. Spent some months searcing when a good friend of mine talked me into trying a QA internship position on a german company that had an office in Portugal. I've been a complete nerd all my life and spent countless hours playing counter strike and other games in my old pc, so you can imagine that compared to the law intership the possibility of working testing software seemed way better to me. I studied the role to the best of my efforts and luckily I was accepted on the internship. My QA career started right there. After that I got hooked and started learning more and more. Eventually learned how to code automated tests (which, btw is not as hard as coding complex software) and started having even more fun performing my role.

# Possible pathways for entry
There are many roles in the tech industry, I will mention the ones I know best and I believe to be the most common.

## Technical
Technical roles will require technical experise, like coding, testing, being able to make technical configurations or use technical programs.

### QA
Quality Assurance, someone responsible for the quality or a portion (like a feature of a site, for instance, a cart feature on an ecommerce site) of the product for a business. This person will work along with the developers testing their code by 
#### QA analyst
#### QA Engineer
### Developer
#### Full stack
#### FE
#### Backend
#### iOS
#### Android
#### Devops
### Team lead

## Non technical
### Agile Coach/Scrum Master
### Product Owner
### Team lead
